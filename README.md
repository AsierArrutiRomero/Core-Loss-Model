# Core-Loss-Model
Repositery with all relevant work regarding core loss modelling.

This repository is currently under work, and will be updated with:

a) all relevant information regarding the work published in APEC 2026 before the event, including 
   a.1) datasets used for the models  
   a.2) relevant results and model accuracies compared with original datasets  
   a.3) examples of application for different waveforms  
   a.4) shareable loss functions  

b) additional relevant information as the model is improved and updated
